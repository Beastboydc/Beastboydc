- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Beastboydc
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making my own magic mirror and would like to have voice control 
and communicate with my Google thingy and possibly have a mic and some speakers at th
e bottom sort of like a sound bar so I can say "play some ub40 on the mirror please google" 
and magically it begins to play some reggae without having to touch a button. Is this possible?! 

I am fairly laid back and a good person to talk to, I am fairly new to coding and rasp pi and
 arduinos but I am getting there bit by bit. Eventually I would like everything to be smart in 
my little flat using arduino for the curtains, anving the TV pop out from the cabinet or projector
 slide down from the ceiling etc, I would also like to get rid of all the light switches and plugs 
around and have then all hidden either behind sliding plates or popping up out the floor just by voice.

Wireless charging on the phone table so the wires aren't all over and generally just have some nice lighting 
around the place to relax in the evenings! I might end up writing loads on here and asking for help as I progress
so I hope not to be a pain to those who may help me in the future!

Bye for now, 

Dougie ðŸ˜ƒ
